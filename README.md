# Zomato-clone

👋🏼 Hello. 
✨ I have tried my hands at frontend web development with this simple yet very helpful project.
🥪 I have used basic HTML and CSS to create the basic functions of Zomato website and have given almost similar styling to the elements.
💪🏼 Since this is my first self taught project, it is not a very significant move. But, I shall try to improve this project further and hope to add functionality too.

😄 Thank You.
